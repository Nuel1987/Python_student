# Python_student
WEEK 1
Instructions:
Create a new Python file and name it "user_input.py"
Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called "name".
Use the input() function to ask the user for their age and store it in a variable called "age".
Use the input() function to ask the user for their location and store it in a variable called "location".
Print out a personalized message using the user's name, age, and location. For example: "Hello [name], you are [age] years old and live in [location]."
Save and run the program to see the output.

WEEK 2
Create an empty list called my_list.
Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.
Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.
Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
Remove the last element from my_list.
Sort my_list in ascending order.
Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.


week 3
Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

Week 4
File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
Error Handling Lab 🧪: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn’t exist or can’t be read.
Outcomes 🎉

By the end of this module, you’ll be skilled in managing files efficiently in Python, ensuring error-free code that gracefully handles unexpected issues. Mastering files and exception handling will allow you to build strong, robust applications!
